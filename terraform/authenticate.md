## üîê Authenticating Terraform with Azure (Using the `azurerm` Provider)

When using Terraform with Azure, there are several ways to authenticate. Here are the most common and secure methods:

---

### ‚úÖ **Recommended for Local/Dev:** Authenticate via Azure CLI

This is the easiest option for development and testing.

1. Log in to Azure using the CLI:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. Then run your Terraform commands (e.g., `terraform init`, `terraform apply`).

No credentials are required in code ‚Äî Terraform automatically uses the CLI context:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

‚úÖ **Pros**: No hardcoded secrets, quick to set up
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**: Not suitable for CI/CD or production

---

### üîê **Recommended for CI/CD and Automation:** Use a Service Principal

#### Option 1: **Environment Variables (Preferred)**

1. Create a Service Principal:

   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>" --sdk-auth
   ```

2. Export the credentials as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export ARM_CLIENT_ID="xxxxx"
   export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="xxxxx"
   export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="xxxxx"
   export ARM_TENANT_ID="xxxxx"
   ```

Terraform will automatically use these values. No need to configure them in the provider block.

‚úÖ **Best for:** CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI)

---

#### Option 2: **Explicit Provider Configuration (Not Recommended for Production)**

Alternatively, you can specify the credentials directly in the `provider` block:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}

  subscription_id = "xxxxx"
  client_id       = "xxxxx"
  client_secret   = "xxxxx"
  tenant_id       = "xxxxx"
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid committing this file to version control.
‚úÖ Acceptable for testing or secure automation using secrets managers.

---

#### Option 3: **JSON Auth File (Optional)**

This file is created using `--sdk-auth` and is more commonly used with Azure SDKs, but it contains all the info Terraform needs.

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "tf-sp" --role="Contributor" \
  --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>" --sdk-auth > azureauth.json
```

You can either extract the values and set them as environment variables, or use a tool to parse the file.

‚úÖ Best when used with Azure Key Vault or securely in CI pipelines.

---

### üõ° Optional: Use Azure Key Vault for Secrets

To avoid storing secrets in plaintext or environment variables:

1. Store secrets in Azure Key Vault.

2. Retrieve them in Terraform using:

   ```hcl
   data "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "client_secret" {
     name         = "terraform-client-secret"
     key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.example.id
   }
   ```

3. Use the value with `locals` or directly in the provider block.

‚úÖ Ideal for production environments with high security requirements.

---

### üß™ Authentication Test

Verify that everything is set up correctly:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If errors occur:

* Ensure the Service Principal has the correct role (e.g., Contributor)
* Validate the subscription ID and tenant ID
* Double-check that you're in the right tenant and using the correct credentials

---

### üß† Summary

| Use Case              | Authentication Method         | Setup                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Local/dev use         | Azure CLI (`az login`)        | Simple, no secrets in code   |
| CI/CD pipelines       | Service Principal + Env Vars  | Secure, automated            |
| Production automation | Service Principal + Key Vault | Most secure, secret rotation |
