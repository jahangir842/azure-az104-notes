## **Lab: Creating an Azure Web App with Azure App Service**

This lab guides you through creating a simple web application using Azure App Service.

#### **Prerequisites**

- An Azure account (you can sign up for a free account if you donâ€™t have one).
- Basic knowledge of Azure Portal and web applications.

#### **Steps to Create an Azure Web App**

1. **Log in to Azure Portal**:
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in.

2. **Create a Resource Group** (Optional):
   - Navigate to **Resource groups** in the left sidebar.
   - Click **+ Create**.
   - Enter a name for the resource group (e.g., `MyResourceGroup`) and select a region.
   - Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

3. **Create an App Service Plan**:
   - In the Azure Portal, search for **App Service Plans**.
   - Click **+ Create**.
   - Select your **Subscription** and **Resource Group**.
   - Enter a name for the plan (e.g., `MyAppServicePlan`).
   - Select **Pricing tier** (e.g., **F1** for Free).
   - Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

4. **Create a Web App**:
   - Search for **Web Apps** in the Azure Portal.
   - Click **+ Create**.
   - Select your **Subscription** and **Resource Group**.
   - Enter a name for your web app (must be unique, e.g., `myuniquewebappname`).
   - Choose your **Publish** method (Code or Docker container).
   - Select the **Runtime stack** (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python).
   - Choose the **Region** (same as your App Service Plan).
   - Under **App Service Plan**, select the plan you created earlier.
   - Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

5. **Deploy Your Application**:
   - After deployment, go to the **Web App** overview page.
   - Click on **Deployment Center** in the left menu.
   - Select your source control (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) for continuous deployment or choose **Local Git** for manual deployment.
   - Follow the prompts to connect to your source and configure the deployment.

6. **Access Your Web App**:
   - Once the app is deployed, click on the URL provided in the Web App overview (e.g., `https://myuniquewebappname.azurewebsites.net`).
   - Your web app should be live!

7. **Monitoring and Scaling**:
   - Navigate to **Metrics** and **Logs** under the Web App to monitor performance.
   - Go to **Scale Up** or **Scale Out** options in the left menu to adjust resources as needed.

### **Conclusion**

Azure App Service is a powerful platform for building and hosting web applications with features that streamline development, enhance scalability, and ensure security. The lab provided hands-on experience in creating and deploying a web app, showcasing the simplicity and efficiency of the Azure App Service environment.
