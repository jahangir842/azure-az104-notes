### Subscriptions, Licenses, Accounts, and Tenants for Microsoft's Cloud Offerings

1. **Organization**:  
   - Represents a business entity using Microsoft cloud services, identified by a DNS domain name.
   - Acts as a container for multiple subscriptions.

2. **Subscriptions**:  
   - Agreement with Microsoft to use cloud platforms or services.
   - **SaaS** (e.g., Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365): Charges per-user license fee.
   - **PaaS/IaaS** (e.g., Azure): Charges based on resource consumption.
   - Organizations can have multiple subscriptions (e.g., Azure, Microsoft 365).

3. **Licenses**:  
   - **SaaS**: Allows user accounts to access services, charging a fixed monthly fee.
   - **Azure IaaS/PaaS**: Software licenses may be included in pricing or require additional licenses for some virtual machines.

4. **User Accounts**:  
   - Stored in **Microsoft Entra tenants**, which synchronize with on-premises AD DS using Entra Connect.
   - Dedicated admin accounts do not need licenses for cloud services they manage.

5. **Tenants**:  
   - Microsoft Entra tenants serve as identity containers and support multiple subscriptions.
   - Tenants are tied to specific regions for services like Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.

6. **Hierarchy Recap**:  
   - Organization → Multiple Subscriptions → Licenses → User Accounts (stored in a common Entra tenant).

7. **Adding Subscriptions**:  
   - Admins can add subscriptions through the Microsoft 365 admin center or Azure portal, allowing central management across services.

## Microsoft EntraID 
**Entra ID**, previously known as **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**, is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service. It provides secure sign-in, authentication, and access control for users and applications within the Azure ecosystem and beyond. 

- Unlike AD DS, Microsoft Entra ID is multi-tenant by design and is implemented specifically to ensure isolation between its individual directory instances.
- At any given time, an Azure subscription must be associated with one, and only one, Microsoft Entra tenant.
- You can associate the same Microsoft Entra tenant with multiple Azure subscriptions. This allows you to use the same users, groups, and applications to manage resources across multiple Azure subscriptions.

### Key Features:
1. **User Authentication**: Manages user identities and grants access to apps and services.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to access multiple apps with one set of credentials.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.
4. **Conditional Access**: Controls how and when users can access resources based on location, device, and risk level.
5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns permissions to users based on their roles in the organization.
   
#### **EntraID Licensing Options**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/licensing
1. **Free Tier**: 
   - 55,000 free identities, ideal for testing and development.

2. **P1 License (Premium 1)**:
   - Advanced security and identity management for hybrid setups.

3. **P2 License (Premium 2)**:
   - Includes P1 features, plus enhanced identity protection for large enterprises.

4. **Suite License**: 
   - Combines **Microsoft 365** with Azure for integrated productivity and security.


Entra ID is crucial for managing identities and securing access in cloud and hybrid environments.

### What is Microsoft Entra? 

**Microsoft Entra** is a suite of identity and network access solutions designed to help organizations adopt a Zero Trust security strategy. It establishes a trust fabric that verifies identities, validates access conditions, checks permissions, encrypts connection channels, and continuously monitors for potential compromises.

### **Microsoft Entra Product Family**

The Microsoft Entra product family encompasses four maturity stages of secure end-to-end access for reliable identities. These stages include:
- Implementing Zero Trust access controls
- Securing access for employees
- Securing access for customers and partners
- Protecting any cloud environment

#### **3. Azure Directories and Tenants**
- **Default Directory**: Each Azure account is automatically assigned a **default directory**, which is also called a **tenant**.
- **Directory = Tenant**: In Azure, a **directory** and a **tenant** are essentially the same thing. They are used to manage identities and resources within the Azure ecosystem.
- **Multiple Tenants**: You can create multiple tenants (directories) if needed. Each tenant can be used for different environments or organizations.

   > **Note**: Only paid customers can create a new Workforce tenant in Microsoft Entra ID. Customers using a free tenant, or a trial subscription won't be able to create additional tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center..

---

#### **4. Working with Entra ID**
   - **Entra ID**: This is the new name for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
   - **Tenant Overview**: In Entra ID, you can go to the **Overview** section and select **Manage Tenants**. Here, you will see:
     - **Your Tenants**: These are the tenants created by you or your organization.
     - **Guest/External Tenants**: These are the tenants you've been added to as a guest or external user.

   - **Switching Between Tenants**: 
     - Select a tenant and switch between them using the **tenant switch** feature. 
     - The tenant you are currently using is visible in the top-right corner of the portal, under your email.
     - You can also switch tenants by clicking the **gear icon** (⚙) near your profile image.

   > **Note**: Only a **Super Admin** can create new tenants. **Global Admins** do not have this privilege by default.

#### **Choosing a License**
Before signing up, decide which subscription to use:
- **Azure/Microsoft 365** subscription.
- **Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)** plan.
- **Microsoft Volume Licensing**.

### Summary: Microsoft Entra Domain Services

- **Purpose**: Provides domain services (Group Policy, domain joining, Kerberos authentication) in the cloud without the need to deploy/manage domain controllers or use a VPN.

- **Compatibility**: Works with both on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and cloud-only environments through Microsoft Entra ID.

- **Benefits**:
  - No need for managing domain controllers or AD replication.
  - Eliminates the requirement for Domain Admins/Enterprise Admins.
  - Simplifies management and integration with Azure for applications like SQL Server and SharePoint.

- **Limitations**:
  - No schema extensions or nested OUs.
  - Limited Group Policy functionality (built-in GPOs, no WMI or security-group filtering).
  
- **Use Case**: Migrate apps that rely on LDAP, NTLM, or Kerberos to the cloud without deploying on-premises domain controllers or using site-to-site VPNs.

- **Implementation**: Can be enabled through the Azure portal, charged per directory size.

#### **5. Managing Users in Azure**
   - **Default Users**: Initially, the only user in a tenant is the one who created the account.
   - **Groups**: There are no default groups when you first log in.
   
   - **Creating New Users**: 
     - There are two ways to add users in Entra ID: 
       1. **Create a New User**.
       2. **Invite an External User** (guest).
     - **Principal Name**: This becomes the **login ID**.
     - **Domain Selection**: If the user is only for Office 365, select the appropriate email domain.
     - **User Type**: You can choose **Member** or **Guest**. For internal users, select **Member**.

   - **Review and Create**:
     - After entering the required details, review and create the user.
     - Copy the **login name** and **password** for the newly created user.
   
   - **Identity of the User**: The identity of a user is tied to the **tenant** they belong to.
   - You can then **log in** using the new user's credentials.

---

#### **6. Entra ID Role vs Service Role**
   - **Entra ID Roles**:
     - These roles control access to resources within the directory (tenant).
     - Examples include **User Admin**, **Global Admin**, and **Directory Readers**.
   
   - **Service Roles**:
     - Service roles provide access to specific services within Azure (e.g., Virtual Machines, Storage, etc.).
     - Examples include **Virtual Machine Contributor** or **Storage Account Reader**.

### **Comparison: Microsoft Entra ID vs. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**

**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**:
- Traditional on-premises directory service based on **X.500 hierarchical structure**.
- Uses **DNS** to locate resources and **LDAP** for queries.
- Primarily uses the **Kerberos protocol** for authentication.
- Supports **Organizational Units (OUs)**, **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**, and **domain trusts**.
- Can be deployed on Azure VMs, but requires extra data disks for storage and doesn’t integrate with Microsoft Entra ID.

**Microsoft Entra ID**:
- Cloud-based **identity solution** for internet-based apps using **HTTP/HTTPS**.
- **Multi-tenant**, flat structure without OUs or GPOs.
- Uses **REST API** for queries, and **OAuth**, **SAML**, **OpenID Connect** for authentication and authorization.
- Includes **federation services** and integrates with third-party services like Facebook.

### **Microsoft Entra ID as a Directory Service for Cloud Apps**

Microsoft Entra ID serves as a unified identity service for cloud apps like Microsoft 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Intune. It centralizes **authentication and authorization** for multiple cloud services, simplifying identity management by using a single cloud directory instead of separate ones for each service.

- Provides **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for various apps, including third-party services like Facebook and Google.
- Integrates easily with Azure Web Apps for **authentication** via the Azure portal.
- Supports both **on-premises AD DS** and other identity providers, streamlining access control for cloud-based applications.
