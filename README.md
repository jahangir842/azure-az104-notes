### Azure AZ-104 Study Notes

Welcome to my Azure AZ-104 study notes repository! These notes are compiled from the **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)** course that I am currently attending at **Corvit Systems Rawalpindi**. The course is being taught by the highly knowledgeable and experienced **Medam Gulnaz Mushtaq**. You can connect with her on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gulnaz-mushtaq/) for more insights into Azure and her training programs.

Throughout this repository, you will find well-organized and detailed notes covering the essential concepts, practices, and features necessary for becoming proficient in Azure administration.

I have also included practical steps and key points to help guide you through each concept in the exam. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute if you'd like!
