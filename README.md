To create a comprehensive and well-organized GitHub repository for your Azure AZ-104 certification notes, here's a step-by-step plan that will not only help you organize your notes but also serve as a valuable future reference:

### 1. **Repository Setup**
   - **Repository Name**: `azure-az104-notes`
   - **Description**: Add a brief description like: "Detailed notes for Microsoft Azure AZ-104 System Administrator Certification."
   - **Repository Type**: Public or Private based on your preference.

### 2. **Folder Structure**
Organizing your notes by major topics will help in easy reference. You can use the AZ-104 exam objectives to structure the notes logically.

```

│   ├── role_based_access_control.md
├── 03_Azure_Compute/
│   ├── virtual_machines.md
│   ├── scale_sets.md
│   ├── containers.md
├── 04_Azure_Networking/
│   ├── virtual_networks.md
│   ├── load_balancers.md
│   ├── vpn_gateways.md
├── 05_Azure_Storage/
│   ├── storage_accounts.md
│   ├── blob_storage.md
│   ├── file_shares.md
├── 06_Monitor_and_Backup/

│   ├── backup_and_recovery.md
│   ├── alerts.md
├── references/
│   ├── azure_resources.md
│   ├── exam_resources.md
```

### 3. **File Naming Conventions**
   - Use descriptive and consistent file names, like `virtual_machines.md`, to easily find and navigate through the topics.
   - Start with numbers (`01_`, `02_`, etc.) to maintain the structure aligned with the exam objectives.

### 4. **README.md**
   - **Objective**: Provide an overview of the repository, including the purpose and how the notes are organized.
   - **Contents**:
     - Introduction to AZ-104
     - Key learning areas
     - How to navigate the repository
     - Links to external resources (e.g., Microsoft docs, study guides)

### Example of a `README.md` structure:

# Azure Virtual Machines

## Overview
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are one of the primary compute resources provided by Azure. They offer flexibility for running different workloads in the cloud.

### Key Features:
- **High Availability**: VMs can be distributed across multiple regions and availability zones for redundancy.
- **Scaling**: Virtual Machine Scale Sets enable the automatic scaling of VMs.
- **Operating Systems**: Supports both Windows and Linux distributions.
  
### Important Commands:

#### Azure CLI:
```bash
# Create a new VM
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image UbuntuLTS
```

#### PowerShell:
```powershell
# Create a new VM using PowerShell
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM" -Location "East US" -Image "UbuntuLTS"
```

### Pricing:
VM pricing depends on the size, type, and region. Azure provides cost management tools for estimating and tracking VM costs.
```

### 6. **Version Control**
   - **Commit Messages**: Use meaningful commit messages like "Add notes on Virtual Machines" or "Update AD Role Management notes."
   - **Branches**: If needed, you can create separate branches for ongoing updates, especially when major updates are planned.

### 7. **Include External Resources**
   - Include references to useful external links, official Azure documentation, cheat sheets, or practice questions.

### 8. **License**
   - Consider adding a license like MIT to your repository if you want others to use your notes freely.

### 9. **GitHub Pages (Optional)**
   - You can set up GitHub Pages to create a web-based version of your notes using Markdown files. It’s a nice way to make your notes more accessible.

### 10. **Additional Enhancements**
   - **Diagrams**: Use tools like [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to add network topology or architecture diagrams.
   - **Glossary**: Create a glossary of terms for quick reference.
   - **Practice Questions**: Create a folder for any practice questions or scenarios related to AZ-104.
