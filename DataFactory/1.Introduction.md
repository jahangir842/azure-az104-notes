# Azure Data Factory Introduction

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based ETL and data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale.

## Key Features
- Create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines)
- Ingest data from disparate data stores
- Transform data using compute services such as Azure HDInsight, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Database
- Publish output data to data stores such as Azure SQL Data Warehouse for BI applications to consume

## Core Components
1. **Pipelines** - Logical grouping of activities that perform a task
2. **Activities** - Define the actions to perform on your data
3. **Datasets** - Named views of data that point to the data you want to use
4. **Linked Services** - Connection definitions that Data Factory uses to connect to external resources
5. **Integration Runtime** - The compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory

## Common Use Cases
- Data migration and consolidation
- ETL/ELT processes
- Data transformation at scale
- Real-time analytics
- Machine Learning pipelines
