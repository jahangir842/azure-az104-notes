# Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime

Integration Runtime (IR) is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory to provide data integration capabilities across different network environments.

## Types of Integration Runtime

### 1. Azure Integration Runtime
- Fully managed, serverless compute
- Best for cloud-to-cloud integration
- Supports:
  - Data flows
  - Data movement between cloud data stores
  - Cloud-native transformations

### 2. Self-hosted Integration Runtime
- Runs on your own infrastructure
- Required for:
  - On-premises data sources
  - Private network data sources
  - Virtual network data sources
- Features:
  - Secure data movement
  - Cross-network data access
  - On-premises transformations

### 3. Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime
- Dedicated for SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- Runs SSIS packages in Azure
- Fully compatible with existing SSIS projects
- Supports both Azure VNet and on-premises data sources

## Configuration Steps

### Setting up Self-hosted IR
1. Create Self-hosted IR in Azure Data Factory
2. Download and install IR on local machine
3. Register IR using authentication key
4. Test connections to data sources

### Setting up Azure-SSIS IR
1. Provision in Azure Data Factory
2. Configure:
   - Node size
   - Node count
   - VNet integration (if needed)
   - Azure AD authentication
3. Start the runtime
4. Deploy SSIS packages
