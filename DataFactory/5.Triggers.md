# Azure Data Factory Triggers

Triggers determine when to execute pipeline runs in Azure Data Factory. They help automate data factory workflows.

## Types of Triggers

### 1. Schedule Trigger
- Run pipelines on a wall-clock schedule
- Supports recurring patterns
- Examples:
  - Every 15 minutes
  - Daily at midnight
  - Weekly on Monday
- Supports time zones

### 2. Tumbling Window Trigger
- Series of fixed-size, non-overlapping time intervals
- Maintains state
- Perfect for:
  - Periodic data loading
  - Time-series processing
  - Window-based aggregations

### 3. Event-Based Trigger
- Responds to events in Azure Storage
- Blob events:
  - Created
  - Deleted
  - Modified
- Can filter by:
  - Container
  - Blob name pattern
  - Blob path

## Trigger Properties

### Schedule Trigger Example
```json
{
    "name": "DailyTrigger",
    "type": "ScheduleTrigger",
    "typeProperties": {
        "recurrence": {
            "frequency": "Day",
            "interval": 1,
            "startTime": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "timeZone": "UTC"
        }
    }
}
```

### Tumbling Window Example
```json
{
    "name": "HourlyTrigger",
    "type": "TumblingWindowTrigger",
    "typeProperties": {
        "frequency": "Hour",
        "interval": 1,
        "startTime": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "delay": "00:00:00",
        "retryPolicy": {
            "count": 3,
            "intervalInSeconds": 30
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
1. Use appropriate trigger type for use case
2. Configure retry policies
3. Consider time zones
4. Monitor trigger history
5. Set up alerts for trigger failures
6. Use dependencies between triggers when needed
7. Test triggers with small datasets first
